                    <p>Differences between SQL vs NoSQL are:

                        SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.

                        SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
                        SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
                        SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
                        SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>

                    <p>JWT authentication is a token-based stateless authentication mechanism. It is popularly used as a client-side-based stateless session, this means the server doesn't have to completely rely on a data store (or) database to save session information. JWTs can be encrypted, but they are typically encoded & signed.8</p>

                    <p> JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that is lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted. Both Java and HTML include it. Node.js, on the other hand, is a V8-based server-side programming language.

                        As a result, it is used to create network-centric applications. It's a networked system made for data-intensive real-time applications. If we compare node js vs. python, it is clear that node js will always be the preferred option.JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node.js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language. It requires libraries that can be conveniently accessed from JavaScript programming to be more helpful.</p>
